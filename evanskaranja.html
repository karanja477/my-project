        <h1>Descripition of the Project</h1>
        <div class="test-box">The project is a web-application that generates a name of a Ghananian child based on the date he/she was born and their gender. It provides a form where an individual or the user should input their birthdate and choose their gender. Dates should follow a particular format as will be explained in the subsequent paragraphs. Non adherence to the date format will result to a snap. The project has adopted several technologies to ease the workability of the application.</div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-3">
        <h2>Key in your Birth Details</h2>
        Enter your birth date in the format as decribed here. mm/dd/yy.
        where
        <ol>
          <li>Where "mm" stands for the month one was born"</li>
